Hello, this is one of the python course I am taking on Udemy where I learn more about python and develop app-based for everyday usage. I have taken a pleage to code everyday for 100 days.

I, Jimmy Trieudang, am committed to completing the 100 days of Python challenge.
I hereby pledge to work for at least an hour on Python programming for 100 days.
I will keep myself on track, even though some days I might feel tired or frustrated.
I will keep myself accountable, even though I have lots of things to do, I will make this a priority in my
life.
I will overcome difficulties and achieve my goal.
I will become a Python developer.
I believe in myself.
